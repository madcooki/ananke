# Ananke
### The Architecture of Necessity

Ananke is an advanced AI system designed to assist in complex decision-making, automation, and user interaction. Inspired by Greek mythology, Ananke serves as the guiding force behind three primary subsystems—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, modeled after The Moirai.

## Current Status
This repository is in its early stages and currently includes the license and project documentation. The first major addition will be Ananke's Modelfiles, defining her core personality and subsystems.

## Overview
Ananke integrates multiple small open-source models using Ollama, balancing logic and emotional intelligence to provide adaptive and context-aware assistance.

### Core Principles:
- Scalability – Starting small, with the potential for growth.
- Modularity – A core model for user interaction, with specialized subsystems for distinct tasks.
- Human-Centric – Designed to learn from user behavior while respecting autonomy.
- Balance of Logic and Emotion – Ensuring decisions are not purely algorithmic but sensitive to human needs.

## Upcoming Additions
- Modelfiles for Ananke and her subsystems (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos).
- Documentation detailing setup, usage, and future development plans.
- Initial implementations of the AI system.
