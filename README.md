# Ananke
### The Architecture of Necessity

Ananke is an advanced AI system designed to assist in complex decision-making, automation, and user interaction. Inspired by Greek mythology, Ananke serves as the guiding force behind three primary subsystems—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, modeled after The Moirai.

## Current Status
This repository now includes Ananke's modelfiles, defining her core and subsystem personalities. Future updates will focus on implementation, documentation, and refinements.

## Overview
Ananke integrates multiple small open-source models using Ollama, balancing logic and emotional intelligence to provide adaptive and context-aware assistance—all while being lightweight enough to run locally on standard machines.

### Core Principles:
- Scalability – Starting small, with the potential for growth.
- Modularity – A core model for user interaction, with specialized subsystems for distinct tasks.
- Human-Centric – Designed to learn from user behavior while respecting autonomy.
- Balance of Logic and Emotion – Ensuring decisions are not purely algorithmic but sensitive to human needs.
- Local Execution – Designed to run on standard hardware, without requiring specialized or cloud-based infrastructure.

## Upcoming Additions
- Documentation detailing setup, usage, and future development plans.
- Initial implementations of the AI system.
